# Sentiment-Analysis
This repository contains a Sentiment Analysis project that classifies the sentiment of text data as positive, negative, or neutral. The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately determine the sentiment expressed in a given piece of text, which can be applied to various applications such as social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and more.

* emoji 
* NLTK

* Fasttext
* ruqia
* camel_tools
* pyarabic

# Preprocessing
Before feeding the data into the model, several preprocessing steps are performed:

Tokenization: Breaking down text into individual words or tokens.
Lowercasing: Converting all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
Stopword Removal: Removing common words that do not contribute to sentiment.

# Model
The model used in this project is a machine learning classifier trained on the preprocessed text data. Several models have been experimented with, including:

* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Naive Bayes
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* SGD
* LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Neural Network
* GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
* Bidirectional LSTM
* Transformers

#  Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Osama-Anmar/Sentiment-Analysis.git
cd Sentiment-Analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#  Usage
Just insert your text in **text** of model inference
